## Current warnings

evaluation warning: The option `plugins.nvim-tree.disableNetrw' defined in `/nix/store/28r25kwzgsh8kfys9f1jz089xiylw611-source/hosts/home-pc/vim.nix' has been renamed to `plugins.nvim-tree.settings.disable_netrw'.
evaluation warning: You are using Nixvim version 26.05 and Nixpkgs version 25.11.

                    Using mismatched versions is likely to cause errors and unexpected behavior.
                    It is highly recommended to use corresponding Nixvim and Nixpkgs releases.

                    If you insist, you can disable this warning using:

                      home-manager.users.randa.programs.nixvim.version.enableNixpkgsReleaseCheck = false;
evaluation warning: You are using different Stylix and NixOS versions. This is
                    likely to cause errors and unexpected behavior. It is highly
                    recommended that you use a version of Stylix that matches your chosen
                    version of NixOS.

                    If you are willing to accept the risks that come with using
                    mismatched versions, you may disable this warning by adding

                        stylix.enableReleaseChecks = false;

                    to your configuration.
evaluation warning: randa profile: The option `plugins.nvim-tree.disableNetrw' defined in `/nix/store/28r25kwzgsh8kfys9f1jz089xiylw611-source/hosts/home-pc/vim.nix' has been renamed to `plugins.nvim-tree.settings.disable_netrw'.
evaluation warning: randa profile: You are using Nixvim version 26.05 and Nixpkgs version 25.11.

                    Using mismatched versions is likely to cause errors and unexpected behavior.
                    It is highly recommended to use corresponding Nixvim and Nixpkgs releases.

                    If you insist, you can disable this warning using:

                      home-manager.users.randa.programs.nixvim.version.enableNixpkgsReleaseCheck = false;
evaluation warning: randa profile: The option `programs.git.userEmail' defined in `/nix/store/28r25kwzgsh8kfys9f1jz089xiylw611-source/hosts/home-pc/git.nix' has been renamed to `programs.git.settings.user.email'.
evaluation warning: randa profile: The option `programs.git.userName' defined in `/nix/store/28r25kwzgsh8kfys9f1jz089xiylw611-source/hosts/home-pc/git.nix' has been renamed to `programs.git.settings.user.name'.
evaluation warning: randa profile: The option `programs.git.extraConfig' defined in `/nix/store/28r25kwzgsh8kfys9f1jz089xiylw611-source/hosts/home-pc/git.nix' has been renamed to `programs.git.settings'.
evaluation warning: randa profile: You are using

                      Home Manager version 26.05 and
                      Nixpkgs version 25.11.

                    Using mismatched versions is likely to cause errors and unexpected
                    behavior. It is therefore highly recommended to use a release of Home
                    Manager that corresponds with your chosen release of Nixpkgs.

                    If you insist then you can disable this warning by adding

                      home.enableNixpkgsReleaseCheck = false;

                    to your configuration.
