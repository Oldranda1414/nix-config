# My nix-config

This repo contains my nix configuration files

<!-- ## Usage

KEEP IN MIND THAT RUNNING THIS CONFIGURATION AS IS WILL SETUP YOUR SYSTEM TO MY CONFIGURATION, INCLUDING ALL MY USERS AND ACCOUNTS

To setup my configuration on a NEW NixOS installation:

`curl -L raw.githubusercontent.com/Oldranda1414/nix-config/main/install.sh | sudo bash`

On reboot you will be greeted with my configuration.

The user `randa` will be created with the password `12345`.

### Check it out in vm

If you want to checkout my system just try it out in vm!

The following guide will use `nix-shell` to have you use the dependencies in a temporary nix-shell.

Nix must be installed to use the `nix-shell` command [download](https://nixos.org/download/).

cd into the vm directory

`cd vm`

Download the latest NixOS iso from the official site [click me to start the download](https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-24.11/latest-nixos-gnome-x86_64-linux.iso)

Enter the temporary shell

`nix-shell`

Run the `run-vm.sh` script with root priviliges providing the path to the nixos-minimal iso

`./run-vm.sh /path/to/iso/nixos-minimal*.iso`

Install my configuration

`curl -L raw.githubusercontent.com/Oldranda1414/nix-config/main/install.sh | sudo bash`

After installing shutdown the vm

`poweroff`

Run the script again

`./run-vm.sh`

Now the vm should boot up to my configuration!

To start the vm subsequent times rerun the script (no need to provide the iso path again)

#### Cleanup

To remove all dependencies temporarily installed in the nix-shell session

`nix-store --gc`

## Architecture

This config's architecture is heavily inspired by [Anatomy of a NixOS Configuration](http://unmovedcentre.com/posts/anatomy-of-a-nixos-config/).

## TODO

- restructure the repo to have a better layout and use modules
- configure oh-my-posh to look like oh-my-zsh (kinda done?)
- checkout <https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads> for inspiration
- checkout qutebrowser and qtwebengine (keep chrome for now, qutebrowser gave me some problems on some websites, maybe because of add blocker)
- add steam for gaming
- fix stylix taking up so much space by disabeling auto enable and enabeling only for pkgs used
- find a better way to run the vm (should be doable from nix directly, no sh and qemu stuff directly)
- test capability of having 2 users with different window managers
- add tmux and tmux dotfiles
- disable nvidia dgpu (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nvidia) on laptop.
- checkout if the option `xdg.portal.extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];` was the reason for hyprland not working properly. Try setting it to `pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`
- set global dark theme, probably with gtk.
- customize status line, probably checkout some i3 rice and copy it.
- nixvim:
    - set vi and vim alias to nvim
    - set telescope to be top down instead of bottom up
    - set border distance to 2 so no sudden shift happens when git info is showed
- add this for laptop battery consumption:
```
  # Disable if devices take long to unsuspend (keyboard, mouse, etc)
  powerManagement.powertop.enable = true;
  services = {
    power-profiles-daemon.enable = false;
    tlp = {
      enable = true;
      settings = {
        CPU_BOOST_ON_AC = 1;
        CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT = 0;
        CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC = "performance";
        CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT = "powersave";
        STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0 = 95;
      };
    };
  };
```
